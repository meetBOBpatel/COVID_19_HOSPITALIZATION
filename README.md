We are creating a database where we keep the track of number of beds and patiets are there. We have different hospitals that has a unique id, has a name, and the hospital type. The hospital where it has taken place can also have the address, county, state, zipcode and fips for city. With all that in mind we finally have the information on the total beds that are in each hospitals, each hospital has licensed beds, staffed beds, icu beds, pedi beds, bed utilization, potential incerase in beds and average ventilator use. With the help of information we can maintian the overall traffic of people with COVID-19 under control!
